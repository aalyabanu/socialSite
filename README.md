The aim of this project is to produce a front end only social media stream (only users posts shown). This consists of a series of social card components displaying posts by a user. It also enables users to create new posts (bubbles) and react to other bubbles.

## Tech Stack

## Functionality

- A Single Page Application built using react router. 
- A visually appealing user interface built using react bootstrap.
- A  component showing posts in the form of "bubbles" that contain each post content.
- Each of the bubbles consists of several react components that disalys the different parts of the post.
- Each bubble consists of a username, some bubble content (text and/or image) and icons to react to the bubble through "likes" and "hearts".
- The ability to click on the "like" button increments the number of likes and same goes for the "hearts".
- A page using a form allows user to add additional bubbles i.e "blow bubbles". 
- When posts are added i.e. "bubble is blown", the user is notified using toastr.
